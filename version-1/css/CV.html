    <div class="cvIntroduction">
        <p>·	Being a motivated and adaptable web student, I feel that I have excellent communication skills and enjoy working with different people each day. I am a self-motivated individual who is keen to learn; confident and a motivated team worker who is willing to benefit the business/company and have a great amount of knowledge on new trends, customer service as well as being an enthusiast in general business and computing. I like being a host and have a strong drive to see things through to completion and would like to work in that environment in the future to gain and acknowledge new skills.
            <br>
                ·	Most significantly, I studied Level 3 BTEC which allowed me to take in more data within the computer science industry such as the intricacies of the way that computers functions. In college I expanded my interest, as well as doing Level 3 BTEC IT I became skilled in programming and coding; my development of making a website, which acquired CSS and Html, made me realize I had gained a specific interest in the coding area. I spend my spare time on the code-academy website, learning and practising varieties of codes such as CSS, HTML,  thus it has to lead me to find out the importance of the codes used in web development and other fields of computing.
                <br>
                ·	Furthermore, when attending Ashton Sixth Form College, I had many roles outside of my current course at college.  So, to keep me financially stable, I assisted my father in selling electronics at Ashton market, to drive myself to earn money and get used to the work-filled environment. Another reason I worked is that it keeps me occupied and determined throughout my working hours; preparing me for future roles. My previous role at Vermillion Cinnabar as a head runner allowed me to advance and gain interpersonal skills: working under pressure. This is shown, when I multi-tasked, I fulfil different people’s requirements and ensured other areas of the restaurant were supported. Also, when I served the food to the customers; communicating verbally and non-verbally was vitally important as I was assigned sections and tables to serve. Additionally, my planning skills affect the way I worked. Successful planning allowed me to plan ahead, when handing out precise instructions and worked my way around priorities. Being an astute observer, allowed me to analyse and manage my time; as well as, being a barista when needed.
