            <h2>Lifelong goal</h2>
            <p>I have a lifelong goal of owning a very successful web agency. In order to achieve my goal, I want to make sure every piece of useful information is taken into account. There are many objectives that I will look attentively at, to achieve my goal such as, taking gender diversity into consideration e.g. in the Manchester Metropolitan University, I have noticed that the ratio for males to females in the tech courses is very high, especially in the Bachelor of Science Honours. Further proving my point, when I was looking at the report by Manchester Digital Skills Audit Report, they stated that there are 20:80 of women in a tech working role <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3749746/mod_resource/content/1/Manchester-Digital-Skills-Audit-2019.pdf"> (Manchester Digital Skills Audit, 2019).</a></span> </p>

            <h5>“I’m a firm believer in goal setting. Step by step. I can’t see any other way of accomplishing anything.” — Michael Jordan</h5>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Growth of the digital industry</h2>

            <p>As mentioned in the <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3749746/mod_resource/content/1/Manchester-Digital-Skills-Audit-2019.pdf"> Manchester Digital Skills Audit Report</a></span> , prior to previous years, there has been a small increase in 2019, which could be because of the rapid growth of the digital industry.The reason behind this exponential increase is due to the substantial impact technology has on today’s society, whether it is for personal benefits or to be used professionally; everyone is potentially carrying a piece of tech around with them, especially phones. According to the <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world"> Bankmycell </a></span>  website, which records figures on the number of people that own a phone, have stated that “there are a whopping 46,639,000 smartphone users in the United Kingdom”  <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world">  (BankMyCell, 2019) </a></span> 
                <br><br>

                Furthermore, these statistics suggest the mass scale of this phenomena, as most people in the United Kingdom own a Phone; in comparison to the small UK population of 65,913,000.Subsequently, this is great news for particular people, as this has a knock-on effect as there is increasing demands for new-upcoming workers that are looking for a role in the tech industry, particularly in the Manchester region. This is evident as there was a 130% success rate of business growth between 2006 and 2016, describing Manchester being the most tech digital working place! <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://manchestergazette.co.uk/manchester-tech-sector-continues-to-thrive/2205"> (Manchester Gazette, 2019) </a></span> . 
            </p>



                <h2>London or Manchester</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://technation.io/report2019/#11-scaleup-investment"> Tech Nation  </a></span> reports that UK ranks 4th in the enlargement of growth in technology, with an investment of £5bn after the USA, China and India. After looking into further depth, the report also states that London is in the race for a substantial-tech investment of £9 bn (Tech Nation, 2019). This is very encouraging to me, as it allows me to have a future viewpoint of where the most exciting prospect area is, to work in, which is London. This itself is financially self-benefitting to me as according to article written by Payscale in London, web developers earn 20.3% more than the average national<span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Web_Developer/Salary"> (Payscale.com, 2019)  </a></span> . As financially attractive as London sounds, the rent amount is unappealing and so I will build my foundation for my agency in the Manchester region, where I can work and improve to the best of my ability. I will continue to do so until I’m successful enough to have full knowledge of HTML, CSS; especially JavaScript programmes in my arsenal and have extensive experience to move from a junior web developer to a senior front-end developer. I will do this by working towards a master’s degree and then potentially move to London or abroad for more financial output.
                  </p>

                <h2>Altering everyday</h2>

                <p>In the tech industry, big successful companies like <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google </a></span>,  <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/"> Instagram  </a></span>and ,  <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.facebook.com"> Facebook  </a></span> must keep updating their services that require better tools and updates and so, this will require me to keep learning and adapting. This will be challenging yet will help me become a better developer because if you aren’t constantly improving and making sure you know the new coding language, it will become difficult to get hired or even advance into a higher job position. With these skillsets, I want to gain a position in an agency to get the inner workings of how things are run, and the experience will then aid me in hopefully moving towards starting my own agency.</p>
