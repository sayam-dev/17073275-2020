            <h2>The steps to research</h2>
            <p>Before creating any mock-ups for a web project you have to carry out extensive research, which I had to do. Most of the inspirational work I had stumbled upon was found on the Awward website; the portfolios that caught my attention were the ones that looked sharp, crisp, minimal but with exquisite visual media content. The research I had to conduct wasnâ€™t just based on the visual part of the website, but I had to establish the way that the content was going to be included. <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.jimdo.com/blog/11-golden-rules-of-writing-website-content/"> 8 days </a></span> had a useful article which fully articulated how to execute content in the right way.</p>

            <h2>Minimal layout</h2>
            <p>Creating the layout was quite an uneasy and elongated process, as I had tons of ideas and concepts that I wanted to go ahead with but as a result of the constant contemplation it lead me to make many mock-ups, but in the end the concept that I went ahead with, was to make my site look minimalistic, yet elegant. I tried to make sure when creating the website, that I went wide as possible to make the content to be the prime focus. Specifically, I made sure not to go overboard with the written content as I personally believe that most of the online users have short attention spans, thus, allowing me to construct and generate the foundation of the website to be minimalist at its core. </p>

            <h2>Colours & Typography</h2>

            <p>Having the blueprints of the website, it was time to get my hands into the design aspect and make it one step closer to creating it.
<br>
                Colour is everything, from monochrome colours, primary colours, secondary colours, complementary colours, analogous colours etc. There are bountiful categories of colours and every website has an array of colours attached to it. I spent many hours just figuring out the colour scheme that would be able to connect with my personality. I went with the Coolor colour scheme, which allows you to optimize the colours the users prefer and has the capability to generate colours. In the end, I went with monochrome and bold colours as they matched up nicely, design-wise which also compliments the colour I used for the font. Speaking of fonts, I also chose Roboto as my main font from <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts. </a></span></p>

                <h2>Visual media</h2>

                <p>The type of content used is very important and without it, a website lacks that edge, even if the design characteristics are really good. So, I made sure to add content, not just in text-based format but media-based, by adding videos and pictures. However, I went one step ahead to elevate the content by using GIFS!
<br><br>
                    You must be wondering why I emphasised gifs like they are the next new sensation. Gifs are a lifesaver, as they allow you to practice best web optimization by turning videos into gifs by either converting them in a video software such as <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/"> adobe premiere </a></span> or the route which I took which was, by using an online compressor such as ezfiles, therefore, making the file size much smaller.
                </p>

                    <h2>Best combination-Grid and Flexbox</h2>

                    <p>The layout of my portfolio was done mainly in the grid system and there's a big reason for that as it allows the website to be very responsive and mobile-friendly. Not only that but many corporations are introducing CSS grid to be used for their websites and more browsers such as <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></span>, <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></span> , <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Firefox </a></span> ;  except <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us">Internet Explorer</a></span> have implicated grid, many more browsers will gradually leap towards CSS grid method, due to having the ability to be a two-dimensional layout, which also eases the flow of the site, consequently allowing companies to create a fascinating layout.
                        I also used flexbox, for certain parts of my website as some parts only required to move one direction only or control the space between certain items (Justify-content: space-between;).
