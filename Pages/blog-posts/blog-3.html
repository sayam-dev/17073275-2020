            <p>Any web company that is about to release their website to the public, always make sure to follow a validation process as it helps to eliminate any errors that a coder can’t notice from their naked eye. “validating web document is really important, as it helps improve ensuring the quality which saves a lot of time” <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://validator.w3.org/">(W3.org, 2013).</a></span> So, this is a necessary step that everyone should be making as using a debugging tool will allow the user to get notified if mistakes have been made, therefore, this improves the efficiency of the standard code.  There are two things that I validated which were the HTML and the CSS which have a different validator for each one. For validating the HTML I used<span class="blg-links"><a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service </a></span>  and to validate my CSS I used <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validation Service.</a></span>

            <h2>Optimisation</h2>

            <p>Speed is declared to be a crucial facet when creating a website. There are tons of websites on the internet today, which advocates the users to spend less time on one particular website. If the website isn’t loading quickly, they are likely to be on the next website in a moment of few seconds, therefore, it’s vital for a website to have any media content to be compressed to the maximum level; eradicating any areas of concern related to speed. So, the first action I took to make my website more efficient was to optimize all the media content, which is also known as image optimization. In my case I had to optimize all of the animated gifs, the reason being that, gifs tend to become much bigger in size when compiled together, which causes the file size to increase. I used an online compressor called <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://ezgif.com/optimize."> ezgif,  </a></span> to reduce the file size. The other images were saved in the png format and optimized by using <span class="blg-links"><a href="https://tinypng.com/."> tinypng. </a></span></p>
